# Example Workflow — `play-subagent-execution`

An end-to-end illustration of the multi-task subagent-driven flow. The procedure
itself lives in `SKILL.md` § The Process; this file is illustrative.

The example below shows a multi-task plan with coherent authored tasks, so
per-task reviewers run after every task. The executor follows the authored plan
boundaries; it does not do runtime regrouping or batching. For a
**single-task plan** the per-task reviewer dispatches are skipped (see
"Single-Task Plans" in `SKILL.md`). On a direct/manual single-task run, the
flow shrinks to: dispatch implementer -> implementer self-reviews and commits
-> mark task complete -> final whole-implementation code-quality reviewer ->
`play-branch-finish`. On the `issue-priming-workflow --auto` single-task path,
the flow instead returns to the caller after task completion so Phase 7
`branch-review --fix` becomes the whole-diff gate.

```
You: I'm using Subagent-Driven Development to execute this plan.

[Read plan file once: .ephemeral/feature-plan.md]
[Extract all 3 coherent authored tasks with full text and context]
[Create TodoWrite with all tasks]

Task 1: Hook lifecycle

[Get Task 1 text and context (already extracted)]
[Dispatch implementation subagent with full task text + context]

Implementer: "Before I begin - should the hook be installed at user or system level?"

You: "User level (~/.config/agent-hooks/)"

Implementer: "Got it. Implementing now..."
[Later] Implementer:
  - Implemented install, verify, and remove hook lifecycle commands
  - Added tests, 12/12 passing
  - Self-review: Found I missed --force replacement coverage, added it
  - Committed

[Dispatch spec compliance reviewer]
Spec reviewer: ✅ Spec compliant - all requirements met, nothing extra

[Get git SHAs, dispatch code quality reviewer]
Code reviewer: Strengths: Good test coverage, clean. Issues: None. Approved.

[Mark Task 1 complete]

Task 2: Recovery and repair modes

[Get Task 2 text and context (already extracted)]
[Dispatch implementation subagent with full task text + context]

Implementer: [No questions, proceeds]
Implementer:
  - Added verify/repair modes
  - 8/8 tests passing
  - Self-review: All good
  - Committed

[Dispatch spec compliance reviewer]
Spec reviewer: ❌ Issues:
  - Missing: Progress reporting (spec says "report every 100 items")
  - Extra: Added --json flag (not requested)

[Implementer fixes issues]
Implementer: Removed --json flag, added progress reporting

[Spec reviewer reviews again]
Spec reviewer: ✅ Spec compliant now

[Dispatch code quality reviewer]
Code reviewer: Strengths: Solid. Issues (Nit): Magic number (100)

[Implementer fixes]
Implementer: Extracted PROGRESS_INTERVAL constant

[Code reviewer reviews again]
Code reviewer: ✅ Approved

[Mark Task 2 complete]

...

[After all tasks]
[Dispatch final code-reviewer]
Final reviewer: All requirements met, ready to merge

Done!
```
